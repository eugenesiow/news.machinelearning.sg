      <description>tl;dr AlphaFold2, an AI program developed by DeepMind, completely blew away the competition in a protein-structure prediction competition, CASP, so much so, the co-founder of the competition has commented that &amp;ldquo;in some sense&amp;rdquo; the 50-year old problem, is solved.
 1. What is protein folding? A protein&amp;rsquo;s function is determined by its structure, its 3D shape. The process, protein folding, is how a protein chain acquires this 3D shape and structure.</description>
