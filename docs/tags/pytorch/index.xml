      <description>tl;dr A step-by-step tutorial to train a sentiment analysis model to classify polarity of IMDB movie reviews with XLNet using a free Jupyter Notebook in the cloud.
 The IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset and XLNet The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) movie reviews dataset is a very well-established benchmark (since 2011) for sentiment analysis performance. It&amp;rsquo;s probably the first large-ish (50,000 train+test), balanced sentiment analysis dataset, making it a very nice dataset for benchmarking on.</description>
