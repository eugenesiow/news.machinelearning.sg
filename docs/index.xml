      <description>tl;dr AlphaFold2, an AI program developed by DeepMind, completely blew away the competition in a protein-structure prediction competition, CASP, so much so, the co-founder of the competition has commented that &amp;ldquo;in some sense&amp;rdquo; the 50-year old problem, is solved.
 1. What is protein folding? A protein&amp;rsquo;s function is determined by its structure, its 3D shape. The process, protein folding, is how a protein chain acquires this 3D shape and structure.</description>

      <description>machinelearning.sg is a ground-up effort to build and grow the machine learning community in Singapore.
News @ machinelearning.sg is a digital magazine that aims to be a place to discuss research and trends in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The goal is to provide accessible and technically informed overviews of the what&amp;rsquo;s going on in AI/ML, as well as a platform for perspectives on recent developments and long-term trends.
It was started in 2020 by a researcher who enjoys these sorts of articles and likes to enable more of them to be written.</description>
