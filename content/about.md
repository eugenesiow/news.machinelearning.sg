[machinelearning.sg](https://machinelearning.sg) is a ground-up effort to build and grow the machine learning community 
in Singapore.

**News @ machinelearning.sg** is a digital magazine that aims to be a place to discuss research and trends in artificial 
intelligence and machine learning. The goal is to provide accessible and technically informed overviews of the what's 
going on in AI/ML, as well as a platform for perspectives on recent developments and long-term trends. 

It was started in 2020 by [a researcher](https://eugenesiow.com) who enjoys these sorts of articles and likes to enable 
more of them to be written.
