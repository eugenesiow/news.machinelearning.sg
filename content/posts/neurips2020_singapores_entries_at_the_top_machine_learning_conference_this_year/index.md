> **tl;dr** *NeurIPS* is the largest and argubably the most prestigious machine learning research conference internationally.
> We look at the 44 accepted publications from singapore-based authors in this 2020 edition of the conference, 
> which is happening live this week (6 - 12 Dec 2020). 

## What is NeurIPS?

NeurIPS is the Conference and Workshop on Neural Information Processing Systems (abbreviated as NeurIPS and formerly NIPS).
It is the [largest conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_on_Neural_Information_Processing_Systems#Topics) 
in Artificial Intelligence with a specific focus on machine learning and neuroscience. Fueled by the resurgence of neural 
networks and advent of deep learning in 2012, it has grown to become one of (if not the most) prestigious international 
ML conference.

## What was the acceptance rate like?

In the 2020 edition, the conference
received [9,467 papers](https://neuripsconf.medium.com/what-we-learned-from-neurips-2020-reviewing-process-e24549eea38f) 
and accepted 1,900 papers, with about 20% acceptance rate across the topics.

{{< figure src="neurips2020_acceptance.png" title="Figure 1. Acceptance rate in each subject area, with comparison across 2018, 2019 and 2020. Figure retrieved from the official blog post on 8 December 2020." >}}  

The three most popular areas, in terms of submissions are: "Algorithms", "Deep Learning" and "Applications", 
although the latter two have seen a decline in the number of submissions. Acceptance rates for "Theory" and "Neuroscience"
continue to be much higher than "Data, Challenges, Implementations, and Software", which highlight the theoretical focus
of the conference and the very high bar for application papers.

## Which SG institute has put out more papers?

In the absence of a better metric to measure quality or impact, we look at the volume of accepted submissions per institute from the 
44 accepted publications that we have identified as having an SG-based author.

{{< figure src="neurips2020_sg_institutes.png" title="Figure 2. Total accepted papers from each SG-based institute and collaborating institutes on these papers." >}}

NUS and NTU top the charts in terms of volume of publications at NeurIPS this year with SUTD and SMU following closely.

## List of Singapore's Entries

We count 44 accepted publications with an author with a SG-based affiliation and they are listed as follows:
